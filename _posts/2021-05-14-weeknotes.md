* My colleage and friend, [Lere](https://lrbr.dev/), inspired me to start writing weeknotes. I want to spend more time reflecting on what I've learned and help shift my mindset to focus on the bigger picture.
* I'm giving a presentation on "highly impactful code review" on Monday and have been spending the week preparing. A trusted mentor helped me better articulate the "why" and vision of the presentation. Learning: I'm great at communicating the tactical "how" behind a process, but the strategic "why" needs some... work. Rubber ducking isn't good just for coding, but for presentations, too!
* I enjoyed reading about two very different approaches to scaling video transcoding last week. Netflix's ["more synchronous workflows"](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-netflix-cosmos-platform-35c14d9351ad) approach is much different take from YouTube's ["build a custom chip"](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/new-era-video-infrastructure). So cool to see similar(-ish) problems being solved in such different ways.
