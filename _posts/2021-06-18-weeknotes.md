* [This](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) seems like a really
great resource for thinking about how to create _actually_ helpful documentation.
I really like the distinction between tutorials and how-tos. (And, it makes me
feel less guilty about always craving / looking for the tutorials ðŸ˜…).
* I've been doing some reading / learning about service mesh architecture which
has been interesting...
* This [intro to Kafka](https://www.gentlydownthe.stream/), illustrated with
otters, is one of the best things I have seen in a while. ðŸ¦¦ðŸ˜»âœ¨
* I played around with [turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) this week and am kind
of excited about some of the opportunities it opens up!
