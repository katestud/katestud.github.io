* I attended a workshop on "Influencing without Authority" by
[Lara Hogan](https://wherewithall.com/lara/) this week and it was amazing. So
many great insights and strategies. It really helped bring focus to some initiatives
I've been noodling on...
* I have reached the point in summer where I'm stuck in an endless loop of
listening to trashy pop -- on repeat. Help!
* Last week, I attended our company-wide (virtual) summit, and I gave two lightning
talks. I feel like I'm getting slightly better at preparing for and delivering
talks -- the strategy of writing out a script (and timing it) before creating slides
has really helped.
* A colleague shared the concept of Amazon's ["working backwards"](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/amazon-uses-a-secret-process-for-launching-new-ideas-and-it-can-transform-way-you-work.html)
document with me this week and I'm really digging the approach. I really like how
it formalizes the approach to start with goals and the problem you're solving.
