* This week, I worked on my (work) goals for the next half of the year. Yes, I
realize it's the end of July already, but things are hard. In some ways, it's a
bit easier to write goals for my current role than in previous IC roles, as I
can more closely tie them to business needs. In other ways, it's challenging
because the goals are a bit more daunting and nebulous.
* I stumbled across [Anti-Patterns for Influencing as an Individual
Contributor](https://punkrockpolly.wordpress.com/2020/10/27/anti-patterns-for-influencing-as-an-individual-contributor/)
this week and the reminder not to rush to solve a problem really resonated with
me. Sometimes I feel like as soon as I hear about a problem, it needs to be
addressed immediately, but that's not always the case.
* We've kicked off an internal Engineering Design Review process and I'm figuring
out ways to increase visibility and encourage participation... I wonder if there
is some magic solution out there to solve organizational discovery issues that
I'm missing.
* I'm becoming a bit more embedded in a (cross-functional) team, which feels
really good. I really value having folks to bounce ideas off of, and I've been
lone wolf-ing it for a little bit too much this summer. Looking forward to an
autumn full of collaboration. üçÇ
