I write this from the RDU airport. I'm on my way up to NYC to kick off a new
(and somewhat short) adventure. I'll be attending a 6-week batch at
[The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). I'm excited, nervous, and everything
in between. For me, this is an opportunity to get back into the
[learning mindset](https://www.viget.com/articles/forever-a-student-fostering-a-learning-mindset/) in an immersive environment with
other folks looking to program at the edge of our collective abilities.

As for what I'll focus on, I've got many ideas floating around. I want to better
understand distributed systems. I want to revisit some of the hardware concepts
and projects I dabbled in years ago. I want to be able to _actually_ explain some
of the CS concepts that I handwave about in a work environment. And I want to
fall in love with programming for the sake of programming again.

Watch this space; there will be many more updates in the coming weeks. ðŸš€
