Hi! I'm Kate Studwell. I'm currently an engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/katestud).

Right now, I'm serving as a staff engineer in the developer experience organization, which means I get to work on projects aimed at reducing friction and making it safer and more delightful for github teams to ship great products.
